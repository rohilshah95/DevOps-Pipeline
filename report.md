### Coverage/Jenkins Support
To report the code coverage of iTrust, we used a plugin in Jenkins called JaCoCo. iTrust by default, on running the command ```mvn clean test verify checkstyle:checkstyle``` generates a jacoco-ut.exec file which is imported by the JaCoCo plugin and displays a window which displays the code coverage of all the test cases. Below is an image of what the output of the JaCoCo window looks like:
