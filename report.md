## Milestone: SPECIAL (Location-based Canary Release)
As part of this milestone, we extended the canary release component for checkbox.io to include a location-based canary relase. 

Based on the location of the client, which is obtained from the client's ISP, we turn on/off features on checkbox.io. The title bar of checkbox.io's index page is modified based on the location of the client. We consider three categories for the client's location. 
1. Inside the state of North Carolina (NC),
2. Outside the state of North Carolina (NC) and inside The United States of America,
3. Outside The United States of America.
